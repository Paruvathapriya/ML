Loan Prediction - Linear Regression Model
=========================================

Objective:
----------
The objective of this project is to develop a basic Linear Regression model to predict loan-related outcomes using a sample dataset. This project serves as a simple demonstration of how linear regression can be applied to a real-world dataset for predictive analysis.

File Included:
--------------
1. linear_regression.py
   - This Python script contains all the code required to perform the following tasks:
     * Load and explore the dataset
     * Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)
     * Split the data into training and testing sets
     * Train a Linear Regression model
     * Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score
     * Print or visualize predictions vs actual values

How to Run:
-----------
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install necessary libraries if not already installed:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the script:
   python linear_regression.py

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Note:
-----
- Ensure that the dataset used is either embedded in the script or placed correctly as expected by the script.
- Modify the file paths if necessary based on your environment.
